  <p>This post will introduce decision tree classifiers. You can follow
along together with the actual implementation in python with
the <code>scikit-learn</code> package.</p>
<p>You can follow the code <a href="/docs/decision-tree.html">here</a>
or download it in Jupyter notebook format together
with the dataset <a href="/docs/decision-tree-files.zip">in this zipped file</a>.</p>
<h2 id="1-what-are-decision-trees">1. What are decision trees?</h2>
<p>A decision tree is a statistical or machine learning model geared towards
classification or regression. We will focus in the classification problem,
and thus we will assume that we have a dataset registering the values
of $N$ attributes $(x_1,\dots,x_N)$ and a target variable $y$ which is categorical,
i.e. it takes values in a finite set.</p>
<p>For example, and this is detailed in the attached Jupyter notebook file,
we can consider a dataset of medical patients in which we register the following
attributes <code>Age</code>, <code>Sex</code>, blood pressure <code>BP</code>, <code>Cholesterol</code> and sodium
to potassium ratio <code>Na_to_K</code>, together with the target variable of interest
which register which drug worked best on that patient, named <code>Drug</code>, out
of five different ones. Let&rsquo;s discuss these variables:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>Age</code>, <code>Na_to_K</code>: these are numerical attributes taking continuous values.</li>
<li><code>Cholesterol</code>, <code>BP</code>: these are categorical variables taking the values <code>HIGH</code>, <code>NORMAL</code> and <code>LOW</code>.</li>
<li><code>Sex</code>: categorical variable with values <code>F</code> and <code>M</code>.</li>
<li><code>Drug</code>: categorical variable with values <code>DrugA</code>, <code>DrugB</code>, <code>DrugC</code>, <code>DrugX</code> and  <code>DrugY</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>For implementation purposes we encode the categorical variables in number.
One can do this in several ways. For our purposes it will be enough
to map for example the
values {<code>HIGH</code>, <code>NORMAL</code>,<code>LOW</code>} to {1,2,3} for the blood pressure and cholesterol
variables, and similarly for other categorical variables.
A decision tree for this classification problem looks as follows:</p>


<figure class="center"><img src="/pics/decision-tree/decision-tree.png"><figcaption>Fig. 1: an already trained decision tree model for the classification problem.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Our decision tree model starts at the top box (<em>node</em>) and for a particular observation
(patient for which we want to predict which medication will work best) it checks
on its attributes. For example, let&rsquo;s say that we have a patient with
<code>Na_to_K = 13.4</code>. The model will then go down from the top node towards the
left branch, because the condition on the top node is satisfied (<code>Na_to_K &lt;= 14.615</code>).
Otherwise it will go down towards the right. In the second leftmost node of the
second generation, the model will now check on our observation whether or not
<code>BP</code> is lower than the cut <code>0.5</code>. This procedure goes on until we end up in
a terminal node, also called <em>leaf</em> of the tree. The model will then assign
to our observation the class written on the bottom of the leaf node.</p>
<h2 id="2-how-to-trainbuild-a-decision-tree">2. How to train/build a decision tree?</h2>
<p>The above decision tree classifier  is already built. In this section we explore how to approach
the problem of constructing such a model from some collected dataset. Suppose we
have a dataset with $M$ observations
$D_{\text{train}} = \left\{x_1^i,\dots,x_N^i,y_i\right\}_{i=1}^{M}$
of $N$ variables $x_1,\dots,x_N$ and 1 target variable $y$ taking values
in a set $\text{Classes}$.</p>
<p>We start with the whole training dataset $D_{\text{train}}$ and select
an attribute index $j=1,\dots,N$. We introduce another parameter $t_j$ which
we will be using as the cut for the first node in the tree. We then partition
the dataset in two disjoint subsets:</p>
<p>$$ Q^{l}(j,t_j) = \{(x,y)\in D_{\text{train}} | x_j \leq t_j \} $$
$$ Q^{r}(j,t_j) = \{(x,y)\in D_{\text{train}} | x_j &gt; t_j \} $$</p>
<p>Note that $D_\text{train} = Q^l(j,t_j) \sqcup Q^r(j,t_j)$. This partition
corresponds tentatively to building the first (top) node in our decision tree.
However, we have to check whether or not this partition is optimal for our
classification purposes. Think of this as if we are trying to partition the
dataset in disjoint boxes and we want these boxes, if possible, to contain
one and only one class of the target variable. We are trying to purify
or screen our partitions to &ldquo;enrich&rdquo; them in some class. There are various
numerical measures of how well we are doing this. One of them is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)">Shannon&rsquo;s entropy</a>,
which in our context is defined for one of the above sets $Q = Q^r, Q^l$
as
$$ S(Q) = \sum_{k\in\text{Classes}} -p_k \log(p_k)$$
where $p_k$ is the proportion of observations in $Q$ of class $y=k$. Note
that this is a non-negative measure and vanishes if and only if $Q$ is a pure
set containing only one class. This can be checked easily by noticing
that $\sum_{k\in\text{Classes}} p_k = 1$ and that $0 \leq p_k \leq 1$.
So the lower the entropy the better!
One can choose the Gini coefficient instead of entropy
$$
G(Q) = \sum_{k\in\text{Classes}} p_k (1-p_k)
$$
or even <em>missclassification error</em>
with respect to the most common ocurring class in the partitions.
Now that we have a numerical measure of purity (let&rsquo;s assume we stick with
entropy $S$ by now) we can vary the selected attribute $j$ and the cut threshold $t_j$ so that
we can minimize the weighted entropy of the partition, namely the function
$$
\frac{|Q^l|}{|D|} S(Q^l)+
\frac{|Q^r|}{|D|} S(Q^r),
$$
where $|D|$ is the number of observations in the original dataset. This will
select, as in our example of a trained decision tree above, the <code>Na_to_K</code>
attribute ($j$) and the cut $t=14.615$.</p>
<p>The algorithm then proceeds iteratively. Let us take the left subset $Q^r$ now as the
starting dataset overwriting $D$. Should we obtain that $D$ is already pure,
we stop there, as there&rsquo;s nothing we can do to improve the classification,
and we declare that node to be a tree. This is exactly what happens on
our decision tree for the first subset $Q^r$: all those patients responded
well to <code>DrugY</code>, and that should be our prediction for these kind of observations.</p>
<p>On the other hand, those observations satisfying <code>Na_to_K&lt;=14.615</code> are still
very  much mixed in classes. Further classification is needed, and to continue building
the tree we optimize for another attribute and cut. This goes on until
we have used all attributes. The problem is that our resulting tree might
be too big and overly complex.</p>
<h3 id="tree-pruning">Tree pruning</h3>
<p>With a big enough decision tree one can of course achieve perfect classification
of the training by simply memorizing the classes of all observations with
a huge tree, as long as observations with the same attributes in the dataset
share the same class. This is overfitting and it is clearly bad, and we do
not expect such models to generalize well on data they have not been
trained on.</p>
<p>One crude way way we can try to avoid overfitting is by restricting the depth
of the tree, which in our example above was bounded above by 4. One can
also impose on nodes to contain more than some minimal number of observations
to be able to branch out, or a minimum decrease in entropy with respect to the
parent node. Another approach performs statistical significance tests
(this is known as $\chi^2$-pruning) in order to allow some attribute to
branch from a node. This is all known as <em>pre-pruning</em>.</p>
<p>Another set of approaches to deal with the overfitting that arises in
big trees is known as <em>post-pruning</em>. We let a big tree $T_{big}$ grow and then we
will start cutting out leaves and branches to obtain a subtree $T$ that
captures the relevant observation and still generalizes well to unseen
validation data. We consider a family of subtrees indexed by a continuous
parameter, each of which is selected as the optimal solution of
$$
\min_{T \subset T_{big}} \sum_{L \in T_{\text{leaves}}}^{} S(L) + \alpha |T_{\text{leaves}}|
$$
effectively penalizing the number of terminal leaves. For $\alpha = 0$ we should
in principle obtain the same maximal tree. As $\alpha$ increases we obtain
another necessarily smaller subtrees that optimize for low entropy while
also considering complexity. One can select an optimal $\alpha$ and a corresponding
optimal subtree $T_\alpha$ by using validation data and testing which of the
subtrees generalize better to unseen data.</p>
<h2 id="3-further-considerations">3. Further considerations</h2>
<h3 id="31-categorical-variables-and-encoding-them">3.1 Categorical variables and encoding them</h3>
<p>In princple, decision trees allow for categorical features for building
the tree. However, python&rsquo;s <code>scikit-learn</code> does not deal properly with
strings and in particular we encoded categorical variables <code>Na_to_K</code>,
<code>Cholesterol</code>, <code>BP</code> and <code>Sex</code>. For the first three of these, we encoded them
in three numerical levels, and that could be dangerous, because that assumes
a natural ordering between the classes. This is a daring assumption, and one
can choose to perform one-hot encoding instead, which has its own drawbacks
as it for example leads to very sparse trees (see <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/one-hot-encoding-is-making-your-tree-based-ensembles-worse-heres-why-d64b282b5769">this post</a> to read more about this).</p>
<p>Even when we overcome the need to encode categorial data (for example by
using R implementations) one need to be careful about variables that take
many different values, because it leads to exponential computational complexity.
A variable with $m$ different levels will lead to $\sim 2^m$ possible partitions
based on the levels. This means that the algorithm will favor categorical
variables with many levels, for which many options are available and
overfitting will occur.
As a summary, I feel more comfortable with categorical variables with not
too many levels.</p>
<h3 id="33-optimization-subtleties">3.3. Optimization subtleties</h3>
<p>There is some mathematical subtlety in the implementation of the minimization
procudure described above to select the attribute and cut that best works
for a given node, and that has to do with the fact that the function
$$f(j,t_j) =
\frac{|Q^{\text{left}}|}{|D|} S(Q^{\text{left}})+
\frac{|Q^{\text{right}}|}{|D|} S(Q^{\text{right}})
$$
is clearly not even continuous in the input variables. Most implementations I
have read about such as the C4.5 or ID3 implementation partition the allowed
(observed, I guess) range of the attribute $x_j$ in a discrete set
$\{t_j^1,\dots,t_j^n\}$ and evaluate the cost function only on these finite
set of values. Note that $f$ not even being continuous means the minimization
problem cannot be solved via gradient descent, even if we are to cleverly
estimate the gradient discretely!</p>
<p>As a final remark, the algorithm described here is <em>greedy</em>, meaning it
only optimizes immediate decisions without taking into account a global measure
of missclassification, taking at each time the decision to implement the cut
which better improves a metric for that particular step. Clearly we can be
building only locally optimal trees; the issue is that the set of all possible
trees grows exponentially with the training dataset size and the number of
variables, and exploring this vast maze of possible decision trees is a computationally unfeasible,
even for just categorical attributes.</p>
