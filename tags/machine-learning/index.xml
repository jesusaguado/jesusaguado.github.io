      <description>Geometry and analysis of spatial data on the Earth This is a short post about the DBSCAN algorithm when applied to spatial datapoints on the Earth. I became interested in this when trying to cluster weatherstations in Canada.
Clustering is a technique in unsupervised machine learning that, given a numeric dataset, aims at bundling together some observations based on coordinate similarities. When working with abstract data, we often think of this dataset as lying on \(m\)-dimensional space \(\mathbb{R}^m\), where \(m\) is the number of variables or columns in our data.</description>
